# Tech & Security Blog

This repository hosts my personal blog website where I write about cybersecurity, cloud security, hands-on labs, and technical learning journeys.
The goal of this blog is to document what I learn, explain complex concepts in simple terms, and share practical insights from coursework, labs, and real-world experience.
